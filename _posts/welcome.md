# Welcome to My Blog!

This is the first post on my new blog. Since my portfolio is built with React, I decided to integrate a markdown-based blog directly into the site.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to read and write. It's perfect for blogging because it allows you to focus on the content without worrying about complex HTML structures.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in simple Markdown.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks are automatically highlighted.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktop and mobile.

Stay tuned for more updates!
