# Mathematical Foundations

Data science relies heavily on mathematical concepts. Here are a few key examples formatted beautifully in this journal.

## Linear Regression

The simple linear regression model is defined as:

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon $$

Where:
- $Y$ is the dependent variable
- $X$ is the independent variable
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta_1$ is the slope
- $\epsilon$ is the error term

## The Normal Distribution

The probability density function of the normal distribution is given by:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2} $$

## Neural Network Activation

The Sigmoid activation function, commonly used in neural networks:

$$ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} $$

## Matrix Multiplication

Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix and $B$ be an $n \times p$ matrix:

$$ (AB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n A_{ik}B_{kj} $$
