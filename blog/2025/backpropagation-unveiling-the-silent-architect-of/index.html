You feed them data, they learn patterns, and then they make predictions. But there’s a huge, fundamental question lurking beneath that simple description: <em>how</em> do they learn? How does a network adjust its internal knobs and dials to get better at a task?</p> <p>For a long time, this was a massive bottleneck in AI research. Then, in the 1980s, a generalized version of an algorithm called <strong>Backpropagation</strong> (often shortened to “backprop”) came to prominence, and it completely revolutionized the field. It’s not an exaggeration to say that without backprop, modern deep learning as we know it wouldn’t exist.</p> <p>So, let’s pull back the curtain and peek inside this incredible engine of learning.</p> <h3 id="the-analogy-a-student-taking-an-exam">The Analogy: A Student Taking an Exam</h3> <p>Imagine a student preparing for a complex exam. This student (our neural network) has studied various topics (features in the data) and has a particular way of combining that knowledge to arrive at an answer (make a prediction).</p> <h4 id="1-the-forward-pass-taking-the-exam">1. The Forward Pass: Taking the Exam</h4> <p>First, the student takes the exam. This is analogous to the <strong>forward pass</strong> in a neural network.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Inputs:</strong> The exam questions (e.g., an image of a cat).</li> <li> <strong>Neurons (Processing Units):</strong> The student’s brain processes information, combines different facts, and applies different reasoning steps. In a neural network, these are our layers of neurons. Each neuron takes inputs, sums them up after multiplying by internal values called <strong>weights</strong> ($w$), adds a <strong>bias</strong> ($b$), and then passes the result through an <strong>activation function</strong> ($f$). <ul> <li>Mathematically, for a single neuron, this looks like: $z = (\sum_{i} w_i x_i) + b$, and its output is $a = f(z)$.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Outputs:</strong> The student’s final answer (e.g., “This is a cat”).</li> </ul> <p>Let’s represent this simple flow. Information flows from the input layer, through one or more hidden layers, to the output layer. At each step, computations are performed.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Input Layer -&gt; Hidden Layer 1 -&gt; Hidden Layer 2 -&gt; ... -&gt; Output Layer
</code></pre></div></div> <p>After the forward pass, the network has made a prediction ($\hat{y}$).</p> <h4 id="2-measuring-the-misstep-getting-the-grade-back">2. Measuring the Misstep: Getting the Grade Back</h4> <p>Now, the student gets their graded exam back. They compare their answer ($\hat{y}$) to the correct answer ($y$). This difference is their <strong>error</strong> or <strong>loss</strong>.</p> <p>In machine learning, we quantify this “error” using a <strong>loss function</strong>. A common one for regression tasks is the Mean Squared Error:</p> \[L = \frac{1}{2}(y - \hat{y})^2\] <p>Here, $y$ is the true value, and $\hat{y}$ is our network’s prediction. The goal of learning is to minimize this loss. A perfect score means $L=0$.</p> <h3 id="the-challenge-whos-to-blame-the-credit-assignment-problem">The Challenge: Who’s to Blame? (The Credit Assignment Problem)</h3> <p>Our student got a bad grade. Now what? They need to learn from their mistakes. But it’s not always clear <em>which</em> specific piece of knowledge or reasoning step led to the wrong answer. Was it a misunderstanding of a basic concept (a weight in an early layer)? Was it a calculation error (a bias in a later layer)? This is known as the <strong>credit assignment problem</strong>.</p> <p>A neural network might have millions of weights and biases. How do we know <em>which</em> of these many parameters contributed most to the error, and by <em>how much</em> should each one be adjusted to reduce that error? Randomly tweaking them would be incredibly inefficient, like blindly changing answers on a test hoping to get it right.</p> <p>This is where backpropagation shines.</p> <h3 id="enter-calculus-the-compass-and-map">Enter Calculus: The Compass and Map</h3> <p>Backpropagation’s magic relies heavily on the fundamental concepts of <strong>calculus</strong>, specifically <strong>derivatives</strong> and the <strong>chain rule</strong>. Don’t let those terms scare you – the intuition is quite straightforward.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Derivatives ($\frac{dy}{dx}$):</strong> A derivative tells us “how much does $y$ change if I make a tiny change to $x$?” In our context, it tells us: “How much does the <em>loss</em> change if I make a tiny change to a specific <em>weight</em> or <em>bias</em>?” We want to know the <em>gradient</em> (the direction of steepest ascent) of the loss function with respect to each parameter.</li> <li> <strong>The Chain Rule:</strong> This is the superstar of backprop. If you have a sequence of dependencies, like $C$ depends on $B$, and $B$ depends on $A$, the chain rule says: \(\frac{dC}{dA} = \frac{dC}{dB} \cdot \frac{dB}{dA}\) Think of it this way: How much does a change in temperature ($A$) affect profits ($C$)? Well, temperature affects ice cream sales ($B$), and ice cream sales affect profits. So, we multiply “how much temperature affects sales” by “how much sales affect profits.”</li> </ul> <p>This chain-like dependency is exactly what happens in a neural network! The final loss depends on the output of the last layer, which depends on the weights and biases of that layer, which depend on the output of the <em>previous</em> layer, and so on.</p> <h3 id="the-backward-pass-learning-from-mistakes">The Backward Pass: Learning from Mistakes</h3> <p>Backpropagation is essentially the systematic application of the chain rule, moving <em>backwards</em> from the output layer to the input layer.</p> <p>Let’s walk through it intuitively and then with a bit of math.</p> <p><strong>Intuition:</strong></p> <ol> <li> <strong>Calculate the error at the output:</strong> The teacher knows the student’s final incorrect answer. How far off was it? This is our initial “error signal.”</li> <li> <strong>Assign blame to the last layer:</strong> Based on this output error, the teacher thinks: “Okay, what parts of the student’s <em>final step of reasoning</em> contributed to this error?” They can calculate how much each weight and bias in the <em>output layer</em> needs to change.</li> <li> <strong>Propagate the blame backwards:</strong> Now, the teacher needs to figure out how much the <em>previous</em> layer’s outputs contributed to the error. They ask: “If the output of this second-to-last step was a bit different, how would it have affected the final error?” This calculated “blame” then becomes the <em>new error signal</em> for the second-to-last layer.</li> <li> <strong>Repeat:</strong> This process continues, layer by layer, backwards through the network, until we reach the input layer. At each layer, we calculate the contribution of its weights and biases to the overall error.</li> </ol> <p><strong>A Bit More Math (Simplified):</strong></p> <p>Let’s consider a simple neural network with L layers. Our goal is to find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{ij}^{(l)}}$ and $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_j^{(l)}}$ for every weight and bias, where $w_{ij}^{(l)}$ is the weight connecting neuron $i$ in layer $l-1$ to neuron $j$ in layer $l$, and $b_j^{(l)}$ is the bias for neuron $j$ in layer $l$.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Start at the Output Layer (Layer $L$):</strong> We first calculate the error signal for the output layer. This is how much the loss changes with respect to the pre-activation input ($z^{(L)}$) of the output layer neuron. Let’s call this $\delta^{(L)}$. \(\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{(L)}}\) Using the chain rule, if $L = \frac{1}{2}(y - a^{(L)})^2$ and $a^{(L)} = f(z^{(L)})$: \(\delta^{(L)} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{(L)}} \cdot \frac{\partial a^{(L)}}{\partial z^{(L)}} = (a^{(L)} - y) \cdot f'(z^{(L)})\) Here, $f’(z^{(L)})$ is the derivative of the activation function at $z^{(L)}$.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calculate Gradients for Output Layer Parameters:</strong> Once we have $\delta^{(L)}$, we can easily find the gradients for the weights and biases in the output layer: \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}} = \delta_j^{(L)} \cdot a_k^{(L-1)}\) (Here, $a_k^{(L-1)}$ is the activation from neuron $k$ in the previous layer, which is the input to weight $w_{jk}^{(L)}$). \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_j^{(L)}} = \delta_j^{(L)}\)</p> </li> <li> <strong>Propagate the Error Backwards to Hidden Layers (e.g., Layer $l$):</strong> This is the core of the “back” in backpropagation. To find the error signal $\delta^{(l)}$ for a hidden layer $l$, we need to consider how the error from the <em>next</em> layer ($l+1$) is “sent back” to it. \(\delta^{(l)} = \left( (w^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \right) \odot f'(z^{(l)})\) Let’s break this down: <ul> <li>$(w^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)}$: This term sums up the error signals from the next layer ($l+1$), weighted by the <em>transpose</em> of the weights connecting layer $l$ to $l+1$. It’s essentially asking, “How much did neuron $j$ in layer $l$ contribute to the error signals of all neurons in layer $l+1$?”</li> <li>$\odot f’(z^{(l)})$ (Hadamard product): This multiplies the result by the derivative of the activation function for layer $l$. This is crucial because a neuron might have a large input, but if its activation function is “saturated” (e.g., very flat), then small changes to its input won’t change its output much, meaning it shouldn’t receive a large error signal.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Calculate Gradients for Hidden Layer Parameters:</strong> Once we have $\delta^{(l)}$, we can calculate the gradients for the weights and biases of layer $l$, just like we did for the output layer: \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{jk}^{(l)}} = \delta_j^{(l)} \cdot a_k^{(l-1)}\) \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_j^{(l)}} = \delta_j^{(l)}\)</li> </ol> <p>This process is repeated for each layer, moving backward through the network until we have the gradients for all weights and biases.</p> <h3 id="the-update-rule-gradient-descent">The Update Rule: Gradient Descent</h3> <p>Now that we have all these gradients ($\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}$ and $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b}$), which tell us the direction and magnitude of change that would increase the loss, we can use them to update our parameters in the <em>opposite</em> direction to <em>decrease</em> the loss. This process is called <strong>Gradient Descent</strong>.</p> <p>\(w_{new} = w_{old} - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{old}}\) \(b_{new} = b_{old} - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial b_{old}}\)</p> <p>Here, $\eta$ (eta) is the <strong>learning rate</strong>, a small positive number that determines the size of the step we take in the direction opposite to the gradient. A good learning rate is crucial – too large, and we might overshoot the minimum; too small, and learning will be agonizingly slow.</p> <p>This entire forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, and parameter update constitutes one <strong>epoch</strong> or one <strong>training step</strong>. We repeat this process many, many times, feeding the network different batches of data, until the network’s performance on unseen data is satisfactory.</p> <h3 id="why-backpropagation-is-a-big-deal">Why Backpropagation is a Big Deal</h3> <ol> <li> <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Imagine calculating each partial derivative separately! It would be computationally impossible for deep networks. Backpropagation provides an incredibly efficient way to compute all gradients needed, as it reuses intermediate calculations.</li> <li> <strong>Scalability:</strong> It works for networks of arbitrary depth (hence “deep learning”).</li> <li> <strong>Foundation of Modern AI:</strong> Without it, we wouldn’t have image recognition, natural language processing, or many of the AI breakthroughs we see today. It’s the core algorithm that allows deep learning models to learn complex representations from vast amounts of data.</li> </ol> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Backpropagation might seem daunting with its derivatives and chain rules, but at its heart, it’s an elegant, systematic way to solve the credit assignment problem. It’s the mechanism by which a neural network intelligently attributes errors back through its internal connections, identifies the parameters responsible for those errors, and then precisely adjusts them to learn and improve.</p> <p>Next time you see an AI perform an impressive feat, remember the silent architect, backpropagation, tirelessly working behind the scenes, enabling our digital brains to learn, adapt, and evolve. It’s a beautiful testament to how sophisticated mathematics can unlock seemingly intractable problems, transforming raw data into profound understanding. It’s what truly makes neural networks “learners.”</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/blog/2026/cracking-the-ai-black-box-why-explainable-ai-xai-i/">Cracking the AI Black Box: Why Explainable AI (XAI) is Our Superpower</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/blog/2026/the-secret-life-of-states-how-markov-chains-predic/">The Secret Life of States: How Markov Chains Predict Our Next Move (Without Remembering the Past!)</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/blog/2026/gradient-descent-unpacking-the-engine-of-machine-l/">Gradient Descent: Unpacking the Engine of Machine Learning</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Adarsh Nair.
